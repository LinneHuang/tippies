# Pre-work - **Tippies**

**Tippies** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Linne S. Huang**

Time spent: 
**8** hours spent in total =
**1.5** hours in the tutorial video + 
7 hours in searching for 1) making split with two buttons, 2) Auto-layout, 3) Changing the navigation bar color and 4) making emojis visible while it's selected

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ðŸ‘Œ] User can enter **a bill amount**, choose **a tip percentage**, and see **the tip and total values**.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ðŸ‘Œ] Custom font
* [ðŸ‘Œ] UI animations
* [ðŸ‘Œ] Making sure the keyboard is always **visible** and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ðŸ‘Œ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

  - You can split the bill
  - Using emojis as tip selectors

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- Trying to change the navigation bar text color: 

  ```swift
navigationController?.navigationBar.tintColor = UIColor.blueColor()
  ```


- â€‹Trying to build the spliting function with two buttons like this:

  ```swift
    @IBAction func plusButton(sender: UIButton) {
        count += 1
        splitLabel.text = String(count)
        let split = Double(splitLabel.text!)
        print(split)
    }

    @IBAction func minusButton(sender: UIButton) {
        count -= 1
        splitLabel.text = String(count)
        print("-")
  ```
